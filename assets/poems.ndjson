{"title": "Love", "author": "SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE", "text": "All thoughts, all passions, all delights,|Whatever stirs this mortal frame,|All are but ministers of Love,|And feed his sacred flame.||Oft in my waking dreams do I|Live o'er again that happy hour,|When midway on the mount I lay,|Beside the ruined tower.||The moonshine, stealing o'er the scene|Had blended with the lights of eve;|And she was there, my hope, my joy,|My own dear Genevieve!||She leant against the arm{'e}d man,|The statue of the arm{'e}d knight;|She stood and listened to my lay,|Amid the lingering light.||Few sorrows hath she of her own,|My hope! my joy! my Genevieve!|She loves me best, whene'er I sing|The songs that make her grieve.||I played a soft and doleful air,|I sang an old and moving story—|An old rude song, that suited well|That ruin wild and hoary.||She listened with a flitting blush,|With downcast eyes and modest grace;|For well she knew, I could not choose|But gaze upon her face.||I told her of the Knight that wore|Upon his shield a burning brand;|And that for ten long years he wooed|The Lady of the Land.||I told her how he pined: and ah!|The deep, the low, the pleading tone|With which I sang another's love,|Interpreted my own.||She listened with a flitting blush,|With downcast eyes, and modest grace;|And she forgave me, that I gazed|Too fondly on her face!||But when I told the cruel scorn|That crazed that bold and lovely Knight,|And that he crossed the mountain-woods,|Nor rested day nor night;||That sometimes from the savage den,|And sometimes from the darksome shade,|And sometimes starting up at once|In green and sunny glade,—||There came and looked him in the face|An angel beautiful and bright;|And that he knew it was a Fiend,|This miserable Knight!||And that unknowing what he did,|He leaped amid a murderous band,|And saved from outrage worse than death|The Lady of the Land!||And how she wept, and clasped his knees;|And how she tended him in vain—|And ever strove to expiate|The scorn that crazed his brain;—||And that she nursed him in a cave;|And how his madness went away,|When on the yellow forest-leaves|A dying man he lay;—||His dying words—but when I reached|That tenderest strain of all the ditty,|My faltering voice and pausing harp|Disturbed her soul with pity!||All impulses of soul and sense|Had thrilled my guileless Genevieve;|The music and the doleful tale,|The rich and balmy eve;||And hopes, and fears that kindle hope,|An undistinguishable throng,|And gentle wishes long subdued,|Subdued and cherished long!||She wept with pity and delight,|She blushed with love, and virgin-shame;|And like the murmur of a dream,|I heard her breathe my name.||Her bosom heaved—she stepped aside,|As conscious of my look she stepped—|Then suddenly, with timorous eye|She fled to me and wept.||She half enclosed me with her arms,|She pressed me with a meek embrace;|And bending back her head, looked up,|And gazed upon my face.||'Twas partly love, and partly fear,|And partly 'twas a bashful art,|That I might rather feel, than see,|The swelling of her heart.||I calmed her fears, and she was calm,|And told her love with virgin pride;|And so I won my Genevieve,|My bright and beauteous Bride."}
{"title": "Song (“Love has crept...”)", "author": "D. H. LAWRENCE", "text": "Love has crept into her sealed heart|As a field bee, black and amber,|Breaks from the winter-cell, to clamber|Up the warm grass where the sunbeams start.||Love has crept into her summery eyes,|And a glint of colored sunshine brings|Such as his along the folded wings|Of the bee before he flies.||But I with my ruffling, impatient breath|Have loosened the wings of the wild young sprite;|He has opened them out in a reeling flight,|And down her words he hasteneth.||Love flies delighted in her voice:|The hum of his glittering, drunken wings|Sets quivering with music the little things|That she says, and her simple words rejoice."}
{"title": "Sonnet 40: Take all my loves, my love, yea, take them all", "author": "WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE", "text": "Take all my loves, my love, yea, take them all:|What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?|No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call—|All mine was thine before thou hadst this more.|Then if for my love thou my love receivest,|I cannot blame thee for my love thou usest;|But yet be blamed if thou this self deceivest|By wilful taste of what thyself refusest.|I do forgive thy robb'ry, gentle thief,|Although thou steal thee all my poverty;|And yet love knows it is a greater grief|To bear love's wrong than hate's known injury.|Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,|Kill me with spites, yet we must not be foes."}
{"title": "I Knew a Woman", "author": "THEODORE ROETHKE", "text": "I knew a woman, lovely in her bones,|When small birds sighed, she would sigh back at them;|Ah, when she moved, she moved more ways than one:|The shapes a bright container can contain!|Of her choice virtues only gods should speak,|Or English poets who grew up on Greek|(I'd have them sing in chorus, cheek to cheek).||How well her wishes went! She stroked my chin,|She taught me Turn, and Counter-turn, and Stand;|She taught me Touch, that undulant white skin;|I nibbled meekly from her proffered hand;|She was the sickle; I, poor I, the rake,|Coming behind her for her pretty sake|(But what prodigious mowing we did make).||Love likes a gander, and adores a goose:|Her full lips pursed, the errant note to seize;|She played it quick, she played it light and loose;|My eyes, they dazzled at her flowing knees;|Her several parts could keep a pure repose,|Or one hip quiver with a mobile nose|(She moved in circles, and those circles moved).||Let seed be grass, and grass turn into hay:|I'm martyr to a motion not my own;|What's freedom for? To know eternity.|I swear she cast a shadow white as stone.|But who would count eternity in days?|These old bones live to learn her wanton ways:|(I measure time by how a body sways)."}
{"title": "Sonnet 65: Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea", "author": "WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE", "text": "Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea|But sad mortality o'er-sways their power,|How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,|Whose action is no stronger than a flower?|O, how shall summer's honey breath hold out|Against the wrackful siege of batt'ring days,|When rocks impregnable are not so stout,|Nor gates of steel so strong, but time decays?|O fearful meditation! where, alack,|Shall time's best jewel from time's chest lie hid?|Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back?|Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?|O, none, unless this miracle have might,|That in black ink my love may still shine bright."}

I let it come and go|As traceless as a thaw of bygone snow;|It seemed to mean so little, meant so much;|If only now I could recall that touch,|First touch of hand in hand - Did one but know!"}
